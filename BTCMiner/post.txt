There a bit of debugging code i've left in (such as writing all of the output from the miner to log.log), but this shouldn't affect use.
Remember this is only [b]BETA[/b], it's pretty plain at the moment, but there should be alot more to come in the future :)

Future plans:
[list]
[li]Graphing features[/li]
[li]Fan Controls[/li]
[li]GPU Monitoring[/li]
[li]JSON interface with pools[/li]
[li]Add more pools[/li]
[li]Add support for most miners (phoenix, diablo etc.)[/li]
[/list]

It has taken me a [s]while[/s] a long time, to write this up and stuff, so if you use it and like it, please donate :)
On the other hand, if you have a great idea that I think is worth something, I might send you some bitcents :D
